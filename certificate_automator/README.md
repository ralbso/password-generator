# Welcome to Raul's very own Certificate Automator 3000!

## First things first... _installation_

### For Old-Timers
That is, for people who are acquainted with Python and/or already have it installed.
To run [certificate_generator.py](https://github.com/ralbso/python/blob/master/certificate_automator/certificate_generator.py)
you must install all packages listed within that script. That is, you should run
`pip install PyPDF2==1.26.0` and `pip install reportlab==3.5.19`, if you don't have these packages.
I recommend you create a new environment, as I do in the installation scripts found in this repository.

### For Newbies
#### Windows Users
Please run [install.sh]
